- _**Test Status :** Fail._

- **Issues Found :**
  1. Test failed despite characters being put in all nodes.
  2. Parent code was incorrectly attached to characters' nodes.
  3. Parent code had some bugs that were causing the glitches.

- **Steps Taken :**
   1. Recoded the parent code from scratch.
   2. Attached the parent code to nodes and characters properly.

- _**Test Status :** Success._

### **Test Case #2**
