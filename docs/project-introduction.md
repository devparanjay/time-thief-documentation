## Why Time Thief?

Like any other game, Time Thief was also born from an idea that made it different from the rest. There’s no other 2D game that takes the player through ages and places him/her against the famous warriors and personalities from history among events that actually transpired. A story that’s just the right amount of interesting without being too complicated, and is inspired from real events and people in history, is what makes this 2D Platformer different from the rest.

## Is it feasible to develop a 2D game in the current age?

Today, there are a number of AAA games for gamers to choose from, that focus on all kinds of gameplay. But, contrary to common beliefs, all those games with big production values are not all that make up the Gaming industry.
There is a very large player base of gamers who grew up with great 2D retro games like Mario, Donkey Kong, etc. who still like playing 2D platformers.
Also, every gamer every now and then needs a little break from those big immersive games and wants to play something that just feels light and good.
Moving on from justification of developing a new 2D game in this age, it would be unfair to recognize relatively simple looking 2D games for their own charm. They feel like how a game should, and it’s an evergreen genre in the gaming industry.
2D games will never get old enough for true gamers, is what the simple fact is.

With every new generation, the Gaming industry has been evolving. Time Thief* aims to capture that evolution of stories, perspective, and the in-game environment that the gamer feels.
